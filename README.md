# Image-Clssification-Resnet
1) data_preparation.ipynb :
    - In this file all images of train, test and pred sets convert in to binary arrays.
2) modeling.ipynb:
    - Here i am using resnet for classification.
    - i trained model three time:
            1) normal resnet :   got test accuracy: 0.75
            2) resnet with 0.5 dropout : got test accu : 0.85
            3) resnet with 0.7 dropout : got test accu : 0.78
             Note: in the file only last model is available
